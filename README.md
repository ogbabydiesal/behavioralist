# Behaviorlist
## About
Behavioralist uses a web port of a spectral panning technique I have been developing in Max (and a litte C++) since 2018. 

It uses a modified particle system found in the p5 docs and is linked here: https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Hello_P5:_flocking

The spectral processing and general web audio DSP were built using Max's RNBO framework, and makes use of a stock Plate Reverb effect from their Guitar Pedals library.
